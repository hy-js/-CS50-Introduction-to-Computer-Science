# CS50-Introduction-to-Computer-Science
After graduating from UC Berkeley's Data Analytics Program, I started looking for new courses to continue my education in programming. Although I was trained in the most in demand programming / data skills, I still felt like I was missing some of the key fundamentals of Computer Science. This is a repository of notes and documentation from my participation in Harvard's infamous Computer Science course titled "CS50: Introduction to Computer Science" (via Harvardx).
