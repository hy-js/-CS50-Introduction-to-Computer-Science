# Inputs & outputs

## BINARY
Decimal: each column to power of 10

Binary: each column to power of 2 e.g.

```
binary = decimal
000 = 0

000 = 1

010 = 2

011 = 3

111 = 7
```

Most computers use 8 bits at a time

## ASCII
How we represent letters e.g.

a = 65

b = 66

c = 67 etc..

Therefore:
```
h        i        !

01001000 01001001 00100001

72       73       33
```
## UNICODE
Superset of ASCII, standardised description but interpreted differently

Uses 16 bits (65 thousand letters) or even 32bits

4,036,999,159 = face with medical mask emoji

## HEXADECIMAL
Hexadecimal (or hex) is a base 16 system used to simplify how binary is represented.

A hex digit can be any of the following 16 digits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F

#FFFFFF = white

## RGB
0 - 255
rgb( 255, 255, 255) = white

24 bits per pixel

## ALGORITHIMS
Method:
- decrease size of problem
- divide and conquer


## PSEUDOCODE
Express in human language the ideas of a algorithm

FUNCTIONS - actions/verbs that solve smaller problems

CONDITIONALS - ehat ot do if condition is or isn't met

BOOLEAN - true/false answers

LOOPS - cycle or jump back through code

## SCRATCH
